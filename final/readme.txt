All files within the src folder must be moved to the same folder as project.ipynb.

Dataset is a folder with preprocessed images, as well as joint annotations.

project.ipynb is the project notebook, which has one output of the model we submitted.

resnet_model.pt is the file where the submitted model's state is stored. This is loaded in project.ipynb

project.html is the HTML representation of project.ipynb

In src, we have modules that include Dataset definitions, image transformations, neural net definitions.
